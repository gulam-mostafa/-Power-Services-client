You may be wondering, Do I need 200 amp service With a bit of math, you can figure out what kind of electrical load your home requires. A 60-amp service, for example, is probably inadequate for a modern home, while a 100-amp service is good for a home of less than 3,000 square feet that does not have central air-conditioning or electric heat. A home larger than 2,000 square feet that has central air-conditioning or electric heat probably needs a 200-amp service. Use the equation listed in the graphic above to deduce exactly how many amps your home needs."
